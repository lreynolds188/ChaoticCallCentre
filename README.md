# ChaoticCallCentre

The “Chaotic Call Centre”, introduced in the first assessment task, is a busy company that collects feedback from customers who call in to report on the performance of several telecommunication companies. These calls are in response to random surveys that are conducted throughout Australia.

After extensively using the binary file application you created, the company has now realised that database usage would be a more efficient way of storing, retrieving, updating, and deleting data. They have approached you as their external software programming consultant and have asked that you convert the application you had previously written to a database-driven application (rather than binary file based).

They would like the program to be able to create new records, modify existing records, query existing records via navigation controls, and “delete” existing records. To maintain transactional integrity, the company has asked that you flag a record as deleted rather than physically deleting a record.

In addition to the initial data collected, they would now like to collect the Carrier name (i.e. which telecommunication company is the customer referring to when providing their feedback). A consultant will choose which carrier from a predefined list. An administrator user will have special access to be able to manage carrier names that appear in this list (add, edit, or flagged as removed) via a form that has restricted access.
